GameTracker is a cross-platform app built for gamers to organize and share their game libraries. Users can log games they've played, are currently playing, or want to play later. With integration to the IGDB API, GameTracker also enables users to discover trending and top-rated games.

Built using modern web and mobile technologies, the project includes both a responsive React web frontend and a React Native mobile app using Expo. The backend is powered by NestJS and TypeScript, exposing a robust RESTful API backed by a PostgreSQL database.

Authentication is handled via JWT, with support for both Google login and traditional email/password. GameTracker makes it easy for friends to connect, compare libraries, and explore new games together.
